Code_Saturne 	Code_Saturne solves the Navier-Stokes equations for 2D, 2D-axisymmetric and 3D flows, steady or unsteady, laminar or turbulent, incompressible or weakly dilatable, isothermal or not, with scalars transport if required. Several turbulence models are available, from Reynolds-Averaged models to Large-Eddy Simulation models. In addition, a number of specific physical models are also available as "modules": gas, coal and heavy-fuel oil combustion, semi-transparent radiative transfer, particle-tracking with Lagrangian modeling, Joule effect, electrics arcs, weakly compressible flows, atmospheric flows, rotor/stator interaction for hydraulic machines.
COSA 	COSA is a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) suite of solvers of the Euler, laminar and turbulent compressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. All solvers are based on a finite volume discretisation of the physical domain by means of structured multi-block grids.
CP2K 	A freely available program to perform atomistic and molecular simulations of solid state, liquid, molecular and biological systems. It provides a general framework for different methods such as e.g. density functional theory (DFT) using a mixed Gaussian and plane waves approach (GPW), and classical pair and many-body potentials.
CPMD 	A parallelized plane wave/pseudopotential implementation of Density Functional Theory, particularly designed for ab-initio molecular dynamics.
CRYSTAL 	CRYSTAL is a general-purpose program for the study of crystalline solids. The CRYSTAL program computes the electronic structure of periodic systems within Hartree Fock, density functional or various hybrid approximations (global, range-separated and double-hybrids). The Bloch functions of the periodic systems are expanded as linear combinations of atom centred Gaussian functions. Powerful screening techniques are used to exploit real space locality. Restricted (Closed Shell) and Unrestricted (Spin-polarized) calculations can be performed with all-electron and valence-only basis sets with effective core pseudo-potentials.
Desmond 	A software package developed to perform high-speed molecular dynamics simulations of biological systems.
DL_MESO 	A mesoscale simulation package providing dissipative particle dynamics and an implementation of the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) for complex fluids.
DL_POLY 	A general purpose molecular dynamics simulation package.
ELk 	An all-electron full-potential linearised augmented-plane wave (FP-LAPW) code with many advanced features. Written originally at Karl-Franzens-Universitt Graz as a milestone of the EXCITING EU Research and Training Network.

Fire Dynamics Simulator 	A computational fluid dynamics model of fire-driven fluid flow.
FEniCS 	A software collection for the automated solution of differential equations.
GAMESS 	GAMESS is a program for ab initio molecular quantum chemistry. Briefly, GAMESS can compute SCF wavefunctions ranging from RHF, ROHF, UHF, GVB, and MCSCF. Correlation corrections to these SCF wavefunctions include Configuration Interaction, second order perturbation Theory, and Coupled-Cluster approaches, as well as the Density Functional Theory approximation.
GAMESS-UK 	GAMESS-UK is the general purpose ab initio molecular electronic structure program for performing SCF-, DFT- and MCSCF-gradient calculations, together with a variety of techniques for post Hartree Fock calculations
GPAW 	GPAW is a density-functional theory (DFT) Python code based on the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method and the atomic simulation environment (ASE).
GROMACS 	GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles. It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.
GS2 	A package to study gyro-kinetic turbulence in fusion experiments and astrophysical plasmas.
LAMMPS 	(Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) a classical molecular dynamics code.

OpenFOAM 	OpenFOAM is an open-source toolbox for computational fluid dynamics. OpenFOAM consists of generic tools to simulate complex physics for a variety of fields of interest, from fluid flows involving chemical reactions, turbulence and heat transfer, to solid dynamics, electromagnetism and the pricing of financial options. The core technology of OpenFOAM is a flexible set of modules written in C++. These are used to build solvers and utilities to perform pre- and post-processing tasks ranging from simple data manipulation to visualisation and mesh processing.
Paraview 	Paraview is a data visualisation and analysis package. Whilst ARCHER compute or login nodes do not have graphics cards installed in them paraview is installed so the visualisation libraries and applications can be used to post-process simulation data. To this end the pvserver application has been installed, along with the paraview libraries and client application.
PLUMED 	PLUMED is a plugin that works with a large number of molecular dynamics codes. It can be used to analyse features of the dynamics on-the-fly or to perform a wide variety of free energy methods.
